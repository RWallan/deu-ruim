`Deu Ruim` is a command line interface (CLI) made to help beginners to fix your console commands using LLM.

*This project is inspired by [The Fuck](https://github.com/nvbn/thefuck).*

## Configuration

You'll need to have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) preinstalled on your machine to run the CLI and the [qwen2.5-coder](https://ollama.com/library/qwen2.5-coder) model installed.

### A fast course about Ollama

To install ollama, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> If you use Windows or Mac, please, access the [Ollama download page directly](https://ollama.com/download).

After that, you'll need to pull the `qwen2.5-coder` model:

```bash
ollama run qwen2.5-coder
```

After that, you'll need to configure some environment variables in your terminal:

```
OLLAMA_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>
OLLAMA_API_URL=<YOUR_API_BASE_URL>
```

> [!TIP]
> To generate your public API key, use `ollama serve`

## Basic usage

Simply run:

```bash
deu-ruim <command>
```

And wait the magic happens.

### Examples

```bash
deu-ruim sl

Run ls [Y/n]: 
```

```bash
deu-ruim "git brnch"

Run git branch [Y/n]:
```

> [!WARNING]
> The performance and speed depends on from which model you're using.

## Roadmap

I'm working to transform the project model agnostic and bring some life saviors, for example, having to put quotation marks on commands with spaces.

You can follow the changelog in `changelog.d` directory. I'll create a documentation with changelogs too, to make it easier to follow ðŸ˜Š.

See Contributing session if you want to help the project advance faster.
